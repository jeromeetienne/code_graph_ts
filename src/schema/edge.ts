 *
 * An edge kind is a reference when its presence means the target symbol is *used*:
 * a call, a heritage link, a type mention, an instantiation, a value read, or a
 * method override (an override uses the base member it replaces). Deliberately
 * excluded:
 * - `CONTAINS` / `IMPORTS` — containment and module wiring, not use;
 * - `EXPORTS` — marks a symbol as exported; counting it would give every export an
 *   inbound edge from its module and defeat dead-export detection;
 * - `WRITES` — mutating a binding is not using its value;
 * - `READS_CONFIG` / `CALLS_EXTERNAL` — their targets are synthesized system-level
 *   nodes (a `ConfigFlag`, an `ExternalAPI`), not code symbols subject to
 *   dead-export analysis.
